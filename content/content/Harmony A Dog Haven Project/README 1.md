# Harmony Haven: A Music-Based Sanctuary for Rescued Dogs

Welcome to my final project proposal for CMPA 3301. This project is called Harmony Haven—a fictional sanctuary where rescued dogs heal through music. The idea behind this website is to combine emotional storytelling, music therapy, and animal welfare into one peaceful digital space.

This GitHub repository includes all the planning documents for the project, plus a two-page website prototype built with basic HTML and CSS. The prototype gives a glimpse into what Harmony Haven could look like if it were a real site.

You can visit the live website prototype here: [[Harmony A Dog Haven Project/final-project-scope.md/Project Scope Statement|Harmony Haven Website]]

Inside this repo, you’ll find:
- A `docs/` folder with the scope statement, project plan, and retrospective
- The homepage (`index.html`) and second page (`dogs.html`)
- A single stylesheet (`style.css`) that styles both pages

Thanks for checking it out!
