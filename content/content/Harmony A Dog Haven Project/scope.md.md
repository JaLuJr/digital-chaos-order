# Project Scope Statement
## Project Name
Harmony Haven: A Music-Based Sanctuary for Rescued Dogs

## Project Purpose
To create a two-page website prototype for a real-world concept: a sanctuary that helps rescued dogs transition to adoption through the healing power of music. The site will raise awareness about the emotional and neurological benefits of music therapy for dogs recovering from trauma, abandonment, or neglect.

## Description
This project will include:
- **Page One**: An introduction to Harmony Haven, its mission, and how music therapy is used to calm and stimulate rescued dogs.
- **Page Two**: A showcase of adoptable dogs, each with a short story and a curated musical pairing that reflects their personality or healing journey.

The website will be built using basic HTML and CSS and housed in a professional GitHub repository with all planning documentation.

## Desired Results
- A symbolic and informative two-page website prototype
- Clear messaging about the sanctuaryâ€™s goals and therapeutic approach
- Emotional storytelling that encourages adoption and support
- A complete GitHub repository with all planning documents

## Exclusions
- No e-commerce or donation processing
- No backend database or dynamic content
- No advanced interactivity or animations

## Priorities
1. Emotional clarity and storytelling
2. Integration of music as a therapeutic theme
3. Clean, accessible layout and navigation
4. Professional documentation and GitHub organization

## Acceptance Criteria
- Two fully functional HTML pages with basic styling
- Music elements embedded or linked appropriately
- Dog profiles and sanctuary concept clearly communicated
- All planning documents included in the GitHub repository
