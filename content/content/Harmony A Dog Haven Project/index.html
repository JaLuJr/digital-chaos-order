      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Harmony Haven offers rescued dogs a peaceful space where music becomes a bridge between trauma and trust. Through curated soundscapes and gentle rhythms, we help dogs rediscover calm, confidence, and connection.</p>

      <h2>Why Music?</h2>
      <p>Music reduces anxiety, lowers heart rates, and stimulates positive neurological responses in dogs. We use classical compositions, ambient tones, and personalized playlists to support each dog’s emotional recovery.</p>

      <h2>Join the Journey</h2>
      <p>Whether you're here to adopt, learn, or simply listen, Harmony Haven invites you to experience the power of sound and soul. Every bark has a backstory. Every note helps write a new one.</p>
