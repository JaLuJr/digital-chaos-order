# About Me

Hii, I'm Jarian Lauderdale, a student at Texas Tech exploring digital media through **CMPA-3302**. Iâ€™m passionate about _creative_ expression, _thoughtful_ organization, and _building_ community through shared learning. This site is a reflection of my journey blending technical skills with personal growth.
