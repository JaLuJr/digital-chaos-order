I’ve always loved the Method of Loci imagining a familiar building and placing ideas in its rooms to remember them. Recently, I realized my playlists can work the same way. Each track becomes a room, and the order of songs forms a hallway I walk down when I need to recall specific information.

The Art of Memory community calls this using “palaces” that aren’t physical they can be scenes from books, video games, or podcasts. My twist is to use songs I already know and love. For example, I built a “Study Palace” playlist with five tracks, each tied to one chapter of my info-org textbook. Track 1 cues me to recall folder structures, Track 2 brings up YAML frontmatter rules, and so on. When I play the playlist, I close my eyes and “walk” through each room each song’s intro or hook triggers the concept I parked there.

Memory experts like Anthony Metivier encourage building virtual palaces in everyday places, even the shoes on your feet or the apps on your phone. Playlists are especially handy because they travel with me. On a bus ride, I can tap into my “palace” and review ideas without opening a book.

I tested this method during a week of exam prep. I assigned one song per key term I needed to memorize. On test day, I queued the playlist and visualized each track’s first few seconds. I was surprised how fluidly the terms retrieved themselves. It felt like walking through a museum every exhibit (song) reminding me of the label (term).

Building a “playlist palace” has three steps:

1. Choose familiar songs with clear intros. The first 10–15 seconds work best as mental landmarks.

2. Assign each song to one concept aim for 5–10 items per playlist to avoid overload.

3. Practice by listening and mentally labeling each track’s concept until recall is automatic.


This method blends the best of both worlds: the Method of Loci’s spatial cues and music’s emotional power. Because I already have strong emotional ties to these songs, the memory palace becomes even more vivid. A minor chord can underline a difficult term, while a bright major riff can signal a definition I need to smile at.

Using playlists as memory palaces has made my study sessions more creative and effective. It’s helped me keep large sets of ideas organized in my mind, all while enjoying tunes that define my personal soundtrack. Next time I face a stack of flashcards, I’ll build a playlist instead turning study time into a journey through my favorite songs.
