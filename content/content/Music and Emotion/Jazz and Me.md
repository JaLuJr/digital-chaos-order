Jazz has a way of wrapping around the soul like a warm blanket. Its smooth rhythms and improvisational spirit create a space where worries melt away. For me, jazz is more than a genre, it’s a feeling. It makes me sleepy, yes, but in the most peaceful way. It’s the sound of comfort, of cultural connection, of personal grounding. The trombone, in particular, speaks to something deep inside me.

Whether it’s Miles Davis or a local jam session, jazz brings me back to myself. It’s not just music; it’s a mood, a memory, a moment.
