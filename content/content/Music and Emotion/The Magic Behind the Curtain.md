There’s something electric about being backstage in a musical. It’s a world of transformation, anticipation, and raw creativity. The costumes, the lighting cues, the quiet hum of performers getting into character; it really all builds toward something spectacular. Shows like *The Wiz* and *The Lion King* are not just visually stunning; they’re emotionally rich, and that richness begins behind the scenes.

> “Backstage isn’t just a place. It’s a feeling. A rush. A home.”

## Backstage Highlights
- Costume transformations
- Performer rituals
- Crew camaraderie

Being part of that world means witnessing joy, vulnerability, and artistry up close. It’s where the magic begins; before the curtain rises. This connects beautifully with the emotional storytelling in [[Playlists as Emotional Mirrors]] and the soothing power of sound in [[Jazz and Me]].
