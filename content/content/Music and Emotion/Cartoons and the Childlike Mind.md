Cartoons are timeless. They’re funny, weird, and wonderfully relaxing. Watching them taps into a childlike part of my mind that still loves to laugh and be surprised. Whether it’s classic Saturday morning shows or quirky modern animations, cartoons offer a kind of joy that’s hard to find elsewhere.

> “In a world that demands seriousness, cartoons are my rebellion.”

Cartoons remind me that it’s okay to be silly, to escape, to feel light. They’re my giggle in the dark, my comfort on a tough day. This playful escape pairs well with the soothing tones of [[Jazz and Me]] and the emotional storytelling in [[Playlists as Emotional Mirrors]].
