Creating playlists based on emotions is like painting with sound. Each track becomes a brushstroke that reflects a mood; whether it's heartbreak, hope, serenity, or celebration. These playlists aren’t just collections of songs; they’re emotional diaries. Sometimes I build them to match how I feel, and other times to shift my mood entirely.

## Emotional Playlist Elements
- Reflection: soft piano, ambient tones
- Confidence: bass-heavy anthems
- Comfort: dreamy R&B

It’s a way of caring for myself, of tuning into my inner world. The process is intuitive: a soft piano piece for reflection, a bass-heavy anthem for confidence, or a dreamy R&B track for comfort.
