I think of my knowledge base as a house, not a flat file list. Each folder is a room, each page a piece of furniture, and every link a hallway connecting spaces. That mental image comes from architecture principles: good buildings guide people naturally from public areas to private retreats, just like my folders guide me from broad ideas to deep reflections.  

The entryway is [[!Welcome!]], my siteâ€™s foyer; It shows the floor plan.
